Cross-Origin Textures with X3DOM, Angular.js and the Flickr JSON API
====================================================================

WebGL does not allow cross-origin content to be loaded as models or textures. In this demo, a server (written in Python) is utilized to proxy images from foreign Flickr servers. Additionally, this demo serves as an experiment on how well Angular.js and X3DOM are working together.
