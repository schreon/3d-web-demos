Three.js + 2D Physics
=====================

This is a Three.js demo featuring an Orthographic Camera, shadows and a set of nice shaders. The demo is based on a 2D physics engine which I created in a former course ( Game Physics ). The large marble can be shot at the small marbles by pressing the mouse buttons. Hitting the space bar toggles gravity on/off.
